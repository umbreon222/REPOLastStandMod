# Last Stand

Did you break all of the loot again? Need some extra help killing some monsters to meet quota?
**Not a problem!**

"Last Stand" mode activates the second you break enough loot to no longer meet the level quota. Once activated, a randomly chosen weapon (based on a probability table you can modify via config) will spawn infront of you to help you out a bit.

## Notes

### Mod Requirements
This mod is host only and currently only spawns a weapon for the host to use.
